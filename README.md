##  About the Project

###  Case Study: LagosLuxe ‚Äì Elevating the Luxury Hotel Booking Experience

 ####  Overview
LagosLuxe is a responsive, front-end hotel booking website built with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript (Swiper.js). It was designed to offer users a premium, visually immersive experience for discovering and booking luxury hotels in Lagos, Nigeria.
